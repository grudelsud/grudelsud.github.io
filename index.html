<p>Hi, I'm Thomas Alisi</p>

<h2>I like to build digital products</h2>

<p>
  I am a software engineer with entrepreneurial attitude, problem solving approach and a particular inclination for digital
  transformation and large scale cloud computing projects. I lead the creation of teams and deployment of software architectures
  for data driven digital products and award winning digital campaigns for international brands and agencies. With my scientific
  background, I have published for international conferences and journals and I have been awarded numerous grants.

<h2>I like to help connecting people</h2>

<p>I quite enjoy the thrill of a stage and occasionally appear as speaker at technical conferences to show what I have been doing for work</p>

<p>I am also the proud founder and manager of Devcon.London, an invitation only community of technical leads and developers. </p>
