<p>Our XMas party with the friends @therumpusroom_ was great this year, and Santa brought me a super cool lens for my E-500, the tiny Zuiko 25mm f2.8 "pancake", you can read a review <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/lensreviews/olympus_25_2p8_o20/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We went for some shopping today, and took a few shots with London at its best, nice way of testing the new lens, good performances on low light conditions, really impressive contrast and colours (a bit tweaked here, but not too much, just a touch of saturation), below the results (and full set <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/grudelsud/sets/72157628362123459/">here</a>).</p>
