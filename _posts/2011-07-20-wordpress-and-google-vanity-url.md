<p>I could not resist, I had to have my google+ vanity url on my wordpress installation, and this is pretty straight forward using a well-known <a href="http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/redirection/">redirection plugin</a>, just pick your profile id from google+ (as in figure below) and setup a 301 redirect from &lt;your_address&gt;/+ to your profile, that's it!</p>
<p>if you want to say hello: <a href="http://tom.londondroids.com/+">http://tom.londondroids.com/+</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-283" title="google+profile-id-url" src="/images/google+profile-id-url-544x125.png" alt="" width="544" height="125" /></p>
