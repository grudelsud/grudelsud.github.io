<p>This paper presents the media interaction systems implemented at the Mont'Alfonso Fortress, close to Castelnuovo Garfagnana (Lucca). The stronghold was built at the end of the 16th century and after being abandoned for decades it was recently submitted to a complete restoration. A multimedia environment, made of large projections, was developed in one of the buildings inside the fortress. Users can interact with natural body gestures: the multimedia contents of two tables are driven by user's hands, while projections on walls and floor are activated by motion detection. All the sensing is made using near-IR cameras.</p>
