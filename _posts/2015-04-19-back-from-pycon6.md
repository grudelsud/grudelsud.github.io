Back from [#PyCon6](https://www.pycon.it/en/) where I gave a talk called "Art & Music VS AppEngine", where I showed how we implemented some performance enhancement tricks on GAE to make it work smoothly on content intensive projects we developed along with our fellows at Google Creative Lab London. Here the slides for the talk:

Also, I followed a few talks and took notes for future reference, here's my recap (made with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) and published [here](https://github.com/grudelsud/pycon6-notes)):

Thank you again to all the crew, you guys have been amazing: venue, food, schedule were absolutely spot on. Bring it on and looking forward to coming over for #PyCon7!
