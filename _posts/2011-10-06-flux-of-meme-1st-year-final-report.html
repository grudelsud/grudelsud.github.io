<p>So it is now time to present the results obtained during the first year of research and development on the Flux of Meme project, and I was glad to fly to Milan for the presentation at Telecom Italia last friday 30th. Thanks-a-mil to Laurent-Walter Goix and Carlo Alberto Licciardi at Telecom for the constant support, reviews and recommendations: it immensely helped to achieve this result. And thanks-two-mils to Giuseppe Serra and Marco Bertini (also with the help of Federico Frappi) at the <a href="http://www.micc.unifi.it/people/">Media Integration and Communication Center</a> for the help provided in the definition and fine-tweaking of algorithms. Looking forward to starting Flux phase 2!</p>
<p>This is a quick keynote that highlights the main elements of this geo-clustering and topic extraction tool, using twitter as a main data source but willing to expand to proper context-based data heterogeneous sources.<br />
