So great to go to [Ashmount Primary](http://www.ashmountprimaryschool.co.uk/) for the second year and give a presentation for STEAM week (for reasons unknown to me, they threw an A in the mix, should stand for Arts, which is a bit puzzling, but hey...). The topic this year was *journeys* so I thought it would be interesting to give them a very quick intro to the Google Maps API. I only did Y5 and they seemed to have fun, albeit a bit disconcerted when I mentioned the Haversine distance :)
