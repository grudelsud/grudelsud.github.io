<p>In this technical demonstration we show the current version of Arneb, a web-based system for manual annotation of videos, developed within the EU VidiVideo project. This tool has been developed with the aim of creating ground truth annotations, that can be used for training and evalu- ating automatic video annotation systems. Annotations can be exported to MPEG-7 and OWL ontologies. The system has been developed according to the Rich Internet Applica- tion paradigm, allowing collaborative web-based annotation.</p>
