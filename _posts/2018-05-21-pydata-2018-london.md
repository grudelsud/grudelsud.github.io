Back from [#PyData2018 London](https://pydata.org/london2018/) where I gave a talk called "Do tyres dream of electric clouds?" and showed the interesting architecture we put together at Pirelli for *Connesso*, an IoT solution making predictions on tyre wear status and residual mileage.

Here the slides:

I also attended some amazing talks and took notes, published [here](https://gist.github.com/grudelsud/e3674b9abaa5be7a6e0f0a7584cf4b96)
