I'm moving all my content out of my previous wordpress to host it on github pages with Jekyll. Everything is still a bit broken, but all the content is here. I don't intend to spend time setting up 301 codes for the few posts I have on my old blog, but hopefully the permalink structure should be the same. If you happen to search anything in particular and cannot find it, please contact me via a twitter mention @grudelsud

here a few links I found quite useful while moving things around and getting aquainted with Jekyll:

- [help pages on github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
- [use jekyll importer](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/)
- [a nice post on smashing mag with full recap of all the steps needed to migrate](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
- [poole + hyde theme I am using here](https://github.com/poole/poole)
