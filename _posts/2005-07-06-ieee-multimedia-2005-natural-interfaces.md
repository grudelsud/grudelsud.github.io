<p>The authors present a multimedia system that really works in a  cultural public space. Indeed, if you go to Florence and visit the  museum of Palazzo Medici Riccardi, you might see a queue of  worldwidetourists waiting for their turn to play with a digital version  of the famous fresco The Journey of the Magi, appearing on two large  screens. Visitors stand in front of the screens and point with their  hands to the part of the painting they√Ωre interested in. Two cameras  grab this point and analgorithm calculates the exact part of the  painting the person selected. In response to the pointing, an audio  response gives information on the subjects or objects. Visitors seem to  deeply enjoy theirinteraction with the system, which does feel natural.  Visitors wear no special equipment and use no complex hardware; the  fresco is extremely well displayed, and typically the information is  precise and interesting, with different levels of information available.</p>
