<p>In this technical demonstration we show a web video search engine based on ontologies, the Sirio system, that has been developed within the EU VidiVideo project. The goal of the system is to provide a search engine for videos for both technical and non-technical users. In fact, the system has different interfaces that permit different query modalities: free-text, natural language, graphical composition of con- cepts using boolean and temporal relations and query by visual example. In addition, the ontology structure is ex- ploited to encode semantic relations between concepts per- mitting, for example, to expand queries to synonyms and concept specializations.</p>
