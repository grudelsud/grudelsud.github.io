<p>It's that time of the year again, <a href="http://blog.carlotorniai.net/best-albums-of-2012/">as my friend Carlo says</a>, time to put down the list of my own list of best albums. Just 5, not 450 as Pitchfork or Drowned in sound are used to do. And definitely not the best overall, just 5 albums that impressed me during this year and kept me busy and happy. Here it goes, I'll pick one track for each album and hope it will entertain some random reader:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiritualized, Sweet Heart Sweet Heart</li>
<li>Grizzly Bear, Shields</li>
<li>Dirty Projectors, Swing Lo Magellan</li>
<li>Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!</li>
<li>B. Fleischmann, I'm not ready for the grave yet</li>
</ul>
