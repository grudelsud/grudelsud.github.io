<p>It was the last of a sequence: the project was briefed, submitted for an elevator pitch, then checked in a couple of meetings, refined, presented again, and at the end it won. The project will be funded by Telecom Italia @workingcapital and was presented during the last <a href="http://www.workingcapital.telecomitalia.it/2010/06/working-capital-tour-bologna-2010-il-video-della-premiazione-dei-borsisti/">Working Capital event in Bologna, June 9th 2010</a>.</p>

<p>Goal of this project is to create a semantic web application capable of predicting the future through the analysis and clustering of concepts.<br />

Memes flow through the social networks and can be paired with their geo-reference information to understand how they move in physical space. Terms used in a single meme describe its semantic domain and images, when present, can enrich their interpretation.</p>

<p>Now the research begins. Part of the semantic engine for term extraction and expansion is already working. From my personal point of view I think that two outcomes will be really important:</p>
<ul>
<li>applying results on mobile devices - contexts still have to be defined, but mobile networks and entertainment is an immediate transfer for this project;</li>
<li>data visualization - huge amounts of data are useless if not digested and visualized in a simple and attractive way; at the moment I am exploring Processing, as it appears a good desktop environment, and this is the reason why <a href="http://blog.blprnt.com/blog/blprnt/quick-tutorial-twitter-processing">I cited blprnt.com</a> in my presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any suggestion and comment greatly appreciated.</p>
