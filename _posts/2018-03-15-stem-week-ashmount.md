So great to go to [Ashmount Primary](http://www.ashmountprimaryschool.co.uk/) and give a presentation for STEM week. I had my 6yo boy in the audience and I must confess I had performance anxiety... anyways I think they all had fun, with the presentations below (made with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) and published [here](https://github.com/grudelsud/STEM-1803)).

# Year 1

a Web VR experience with some basic 3D shapes and have a chance to try it on with Google cardboard

A little vanilla Javascript coding session to make some music in the internet browser
