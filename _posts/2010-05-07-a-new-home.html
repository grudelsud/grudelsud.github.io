<p>As I moved to London I decided that my old home had to close since it did not represent me anymore. It still exists, and you can find my archive <a href="http://morpheus.micc.unifi.it/alisi/">here</a> but, you know, being a great fan of ATP, I can't stop thinking of these few words: don't look back.<br />
I have a new mac, a new flat, a brand new national insurance number, a new passion in programming android applications for mobile, and a good ol' addiction for gigs, good wines and joy for life. So if you like all the above and you have a few minutes to spare, read through and I hope we could discuss about all these things. And I won't promise this blog will be completely in this crappy english.</p>
