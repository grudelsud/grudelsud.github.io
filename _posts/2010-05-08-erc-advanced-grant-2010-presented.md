<p>I was recently involved in the presentation of an ERC Advanced Grant. The list of currently open calls are published by the European Research Council official website, <a href="http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&amp;topicID=497">here</a>.</p>
<p>The project aims at realizing a wide and exhaustive study on the Mycenaean culture  diffusion within the Eastern Mediterranean basin in the Late II  Millennium B.C. with the support of a proper cross-medial research, in order to build  up a user friendly macro DataBase of the whole archaeological evidences  coming from the wide area of interest.</p>
<p>Principal investigator of the proposed grant is Anna Margherita Jasink. Her research  activity addressed a variety of topics in continuous evolution with  time, with a distinct interdisciplinary approach. In fact her field  research has been concerned with both philological and historical themes  connected to the Ancient Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean/Near Eastern  civilisations.</p>
<p>The following investigators are the other members of the team:</p>
