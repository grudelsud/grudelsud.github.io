<p>In this paper a composite framework for collaborative working is  presented. The framework includes real-time motion tracking based on  computer vision from standard webcams situated at different locations,  data transmission and real-time animation of 3D avatars in a virtual  world. Motion tracking is obtained without using markers, with weak  constraints on users' clothes and environment lighting. It is based on a  model fitting process that compares the 2D processed images supplied by  cameras with a set of artificially generated views of a human model.</p>
