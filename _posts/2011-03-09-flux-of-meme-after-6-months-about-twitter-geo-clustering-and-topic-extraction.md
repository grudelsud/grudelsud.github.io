<p>It has been quite a while since our first "java -jar fom.jar" and the complexity of the project has constantly grown since the beginning, its tiny team facing every day a new challenge and trying to solve it with the limited amount of available resources. Now it is time to deliver the first prototype, draw a line and define the milestones ahead, but we are reasonably confident that there is room for improvements, and our clustering and topic extraction tool can provide good results. Special thanks go to @fedefrappi who received an email bombarding over the past few months and never lost his temper, great job man!</p>
