<p>Over the past few days a couple of friends asked me more or less the same thing: retrieve a collection of Venture Firms and visualize a simple subset of important data, such as geo location, average investment, and short description. I have hence decided to spend a little time with some PHP/Javascript and implemented <a href="http://dev.londondroids.com/crunchmap/">this simple application</a>.</p>
<p>The application crawls pages from <a class="zem_slink" title="CrunchBase" rel="homepage" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/">Crunchbase</a> to retrieve a set of financial organizations, then update their locations using their API. Details on each organization are fetched through an AJAX request to Crunchbase's API after a marker on the map is clicked. A vector graph is displayed showing the list of the investments of the firm.</p>
<p>The application uses Raphael JS for creating the <a class="zem_slink" title="Scalable Vector Graphics" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> graph, therefore works on Firefox and Safari only [EDIT: it was then updated to google chart api to maximize browser compatibility and now fully compliant]. If anyone interested in the code or database, just drop me an email using the contact form on <a href="/about-me">this page</a>.</p>
